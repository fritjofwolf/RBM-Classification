RBM-Classification
==================
This is a university project I did together with another student at TU Berlin for the course "Projects in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" by Professor Manfred Opper. The goal was to apply Restricted Boltzmann Machines to a classification task, such as MNIST and CIFAR.
